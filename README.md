The increasing prevalence in ransomware attacks in present state of affairs posses a significant threat in security and privacy, integrating various sectors, necessitating robust measures for detection and prevention.This projects addresses the challenge associated with ransomware attack and so we propose a hybrid model for the detection along with security framework using solana block chain. This framework aims to enhance the security of the data and systems, embracing a decentralized structure.The proposed system employs a hybrid machine learning model, to analyse data and detect ransomware attacks. Using Program Derived Addresses (PDA), signature generation algorithm in solana is used for generating signature for threat detection and the block chain is employed to create backups of critical data. Using Principle component Analysis, we perform feature extraction by the comparative analysis.Later, in we develop a two stage hybrid detection model with Hid- den Markov Model. The Evaluation metrics of the framework demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency, showcasing the improved accuracy, F1 score and other metrics of the hybrid model. The practical demonstration of the proposed system does the prevention and detection of ransomware attacks.
